This project is being implemented using Angular 2 JavaScript Framework. I have also used bootstrap for styling and jquery datatable,
to show the records in the table.

Steps to start the project:
1. clone the project into local disk
2. Open up nodejs command prompt and navigate to the project folder.
3. Type the follwong commands:
   a) npm install -g
   b) npm install bootstrap
   c) npm install jquery -S
   d) npm install datatables.net -S
   e) npm install -D @types/jquery
4. Finally, type npm start in the command prompt.

Code Explanation:
1. A new component is being added: TableList, which contains view, model, business logic and service details.
2. I am calling the service url on Init of the TableList component. The Init method is making a call to getData() of TableListService class
3. The service class is getting the data directly from the url and also handling errors(if any).
4. The imports have been done for 'Http','Response','rxjs','Observable' and 'Injectable' modules, as because the service is hitting
   a remote url, which require - requests and responses, rxjs is actually helpig to make the call.
5. So, finally the data is being captured by a variable (dataService) of Interface (ITableListModel) type and is being accessed
   in the corresponsing HTML(view) file.
6. In the HTML file, a foreach (*ngFor) loop being implemented to show all the records.

Note: datatable could not be implemented due to shortage of time. Thus, sorting could not be implemented.
